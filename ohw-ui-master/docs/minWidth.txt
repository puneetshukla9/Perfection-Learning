minumum width fix:
1. in each framework.html, add "col-xs-*" in front of each "col-sm-*", where the "*" is the same number
   that col-sm specifies.

2. In each index.html, remove the line of 
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">, 
this disables the zooming aspect of sites in mobile devices. 

3. In each index.html, change the bootstrap.min.css reference to
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/bootstrap-3.3.5.kb.min.css">

4. in shared/less folder, add the file nonResponsive.less and import it into the common.less:
   @import "@{sharedPath}nonResponsive
